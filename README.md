# Module 4 Project: JavaScript Quiz

## Description

This project was created to start a timed multiple choice quiz about JavaScript Fundamentals and keep track of High scores.

## Installation

N/A we donâ€™t have any steps to take to install anything for our webpage.

## Usage
JavaScript quiz starts and timer commences when I click the start button. 
When I answer a question, another question appears, and when I answer incorrectly, 10 seconds is subtracted from the clock.
When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over, and I am prompted to save my initials and score.
Scores are tracked in a Highscores table.
